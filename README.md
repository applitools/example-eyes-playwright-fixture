# Demo - Applitools Eyes Playwright Fixture

This project demonstrates visual testing of iframes and image resources using Playwright and Applitools Eyes.

## Project Structure

- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `playwright.config.ts`: Playwright configuration, including Applitools Eyes integration and browser settings.
- `tests/example.spec.ts`: Example Playwright test
- `applitools.log`: Log file generated by Applitools Eyes during test execution.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```


## Environment Variables

You must set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to run visual tests. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the project root:

```
APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

If you are using a dedicated Applitools cloud, you can also set:

```
APPLITOOLS_SERVER_URL=https://your-server-url.applitools.com
```


## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```sh
npx playwright test
```

To run Playwright in UI mode:

```sh
npx playwright test --ui
```

## About This Example

This is a simple example project demonstrating Playwright tests with Applitools Eyes. The test in `tests/example.spec.ts` loads an iframe and images, and uses Applitools Eyes to perform visual checks. Playwright reports are generated in `playwright-report/`.
